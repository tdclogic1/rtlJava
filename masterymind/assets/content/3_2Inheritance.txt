nheritance
Summary: Inheritance is an OOP principle that allows a new class to adopt the properties and methods of an existing class. In Java, this relationship is denoted using the extends keyword, where the new class becomes a subclass (child) of the existing class (parent), thereby inheriting its public and protected characteristics. This mechanism supports the reuse of existing code and further allows for the refinement or modification of class behaviors through overriding methods. Inheritance models real-world relationships and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes, making it easier to create and maintain complex systems by grouping and differentiating related classes.
