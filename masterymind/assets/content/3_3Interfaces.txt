Interfaces
Summary: Interfaces in Java are abstract types that allow the definition of a contract for classes without dictating the exact method of execution. An interface can declare method signatures (without bodies) that any implementing class must provide. Interfaces are declared using the interface keyword and implemented using the implements keyword. This allows Java to support multiple inheritances of type, as a class can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces are crucial for defining a set of methods that different classes can share, promoting a modular and flexible approach to system design where classes can interact with each other through common interfaces.
