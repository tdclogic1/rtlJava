Summary: This section introduces software development practices such as debugging, testing, and understanding ethical considerations. It prepares students for real-world software development, focusing on creating high-quality, reliable software.

Example: Writing a simple JUnit test case for a method that adds two numbers.

java
Copy code
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        assertEquals(5, Calculator.add(2, 3));
    }
}

class Calculator {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
