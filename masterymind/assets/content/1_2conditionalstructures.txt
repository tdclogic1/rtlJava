Conditional Structures
Summary: Conditional structures are fundamental to programming, allowing a program to make decisions and execute different code paths based on certain conditions. In Java, this decision-making capability is primarily achieved through if-else statements and switch cases. The if-else statement evaluates a boolean expression and directs the program flow accordingly. For more complex decision trees, else if can be used to chain multiple conditions. Meanwhile, switch statements provide a more readable way to select among multiple alternatives based on the value of a variable or expression. Understanding these structures is essential for creating dynamic and responsive programs that can handle various inputs and situations effectively.

Example:
java
Copy code
public class Conditionals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int score = 75;
        if (score >= 90) {
            System.out.println("Grade A");
        } else if (score >= 80) {
            System.out.println("Grade B");
        } else if (score >= 70) {
            System.out.println("Grade C");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Grade F");
        }
    }
}
