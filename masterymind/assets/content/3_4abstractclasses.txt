Abstract Classes
Summary: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and are declared with the abstract keyword. They are used to define a template for other classes to extend and provide partial implementation of their interface. Abstract classes can contain abstract methods (without an implementation) as well as concrete methods (with an implementation). Subclasses of an abstract class must provide implementations for the abstract methods. Abstract classes are useful when creating class hierarchies that reflect common behaviors and attributes of the subclasses, allowing code reuse while still enforcing certain design constraints.
