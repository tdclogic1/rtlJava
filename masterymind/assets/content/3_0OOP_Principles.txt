Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
Summary: This section delves into the principles of OOP including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It emphasizes creating reusable and modular code through classes and objects, critical for larger, scalable applications.

Example: A simple class definition demonstrating encapsulation with private fields and public getters/setters.

java
Copy code
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
