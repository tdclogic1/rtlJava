Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
Encapsulation
Summary: Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP that involves bundling the data (attributes) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit, or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components. This principle is implemented in Java through access modifiers like private, public, and protected, controlling the visibility of class members. Encapsulation ensures that objects cannot change the internal state of other objects in unexpected ways; instead, they must use methods specifically provided for this purpose. This not only safeguards the data integrity but also enhances modularity and maintainability of the code by allowing changes to the implementation without affecting other parts of the program that rely on the public interface of the class.
