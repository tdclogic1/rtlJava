Algorithms and Problem Solving
Summary: This section focuses on algorithm development, including searching and sorting techniques, and the concept of recursion. It teaches problem-solving skills and how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.

Example: Implementing a binary search algorithm in Java.

java
Copy code
public class BinarySearch {
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int element) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = arr.length - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == element) {
                return mid;
            } else if (arr[mid] < element) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Element not found
    }
}
