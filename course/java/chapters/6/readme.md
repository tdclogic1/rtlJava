public static final int CAT = 1;
public static final int DOG = 2;

The lines of code you've provided are Java declarations for constants. Here’s a breakdown of each component:

public: This is an access modifier that allows the constant to be accessed from any other class within the application or project.

static: This keyword means that the constant is associated with the class rather than instances of the class. This means you don’t need an instance of the class to access it.

final: This keyword prevents the value of the variable from being changed after it is initialized. Essentially, it makes the variable a constant.

int: This is the data type of the constant, which in this case is an integer.

CAT and DOG: These are the names of the constants. Conventionally, constant names are written in uppercase letters with underscores to separate words.

1 and 2: These are the values assigned to the constants CAT and DOG, respectively.

These constants are typically used to represent fixed values that are known at compile time and do not change. In your example, CAT and DOG could be used to represent different types of entities or choices in your code, making the code more readable and maintainable. Instead of using arbitrary numbers, you use meaningful names, which makes it clear what each number represents.
