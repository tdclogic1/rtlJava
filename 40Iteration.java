    int count = 0;
    do {
        System.out.println("Iteration: " + count);
        count++;
    } while (count < 5);

    //This code will also print the message "Iteration: X" for each value of X from 0 to 4,
    // but it guarantees that the loop will be executed at least once, even if the condition is initially false.
