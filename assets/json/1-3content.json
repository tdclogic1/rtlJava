  "title": "1.3 Arithmetic Expressions",
  "description": "Arithmetic expressions are foundational to programming in Java, allowing for the manipulation and evaluation of numeric data. This section delves into the syntax and usage of basic arithmetic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), including modulus (%), which returns the remainder of division. Special attention is paid to the precedence of these operators, ensuring correct order of operations in complex expressions. The section also explores common pitfalls, such as integer division leading to truncated results, and how to use casting to obtain accurate floating-point outcomes. Examples demonstrate how arithmetic expressions are used in real-world programming tasks, such as calculating averages, converting between measurement units, and determining financial calculations like interest rates. By understanding arithmetic expressions, students gain the ability to solve a wide range of mathematical problems using Java."
