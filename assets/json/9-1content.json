  "title": "9.1 Class Hierarchies",
  "description": "Class hierarchies are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, allowing for the creation of complex systems through simple, reusable, and extendable code structures. In Java, class hierarchies are established through inheritance, where a 'child' class inherits fields and methods from a 'parent' class, promoting code reuse and polymorphism. This section introduces the basics of class hierarchies, including the use of the 'extends' keyword to create subclass relationships. It explores how inheritance facilitates the overriding of methods, enabling subclasses to provide specific implementations for methods defined in their superclass. The section also discusses the concept of abstract classes and interfaces, and their role in defining a contract for subclasses. Through examples, students will learn how to design and implement class hierarchies in Java, understanding the benefits of code reuse and the principles of 'is-a' relationships, which are pivotal for designing object-oriented applications."
