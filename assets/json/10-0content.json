  "title": "Recursion",
  "description": "Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, allowing functions to call themselves directly or indirectly to solve problems. This method is particularly useful for tasks that can be broken down into similar subproblems. Recursion is characterized by two main components: the base case and the recursive case. The base case serves as the stopping criterion to prevent the function from calling itself indefinitely. In contrast, the recursive case divides the problem into smaller instances, calling the same function with a different set of parameters. Recursion is widely used in algorithms, especially for tasks like sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) and searching (e.g., binary search), as well as in solving complex problems by simplifying them into more manageable subproblems. Understanding recursion is crucial for optimizing certain types of problems, enabling more elegant and efficient solutions compared to iterative approaches."
